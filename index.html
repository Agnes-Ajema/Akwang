    </div>
        <p>Her story began in Kakuma Refugee Camp, where her childhood lacked the <br>
            fun and learning of a good early education program. Seeing how it held the <br>
            kids back, She wouldn't accept this as the only option. Akwang aims to create <br>
            engaging learning tools and bring virtual classrooms to the camp. Through these <br>
             innovative solutions, She dreams of unlocking a world of opportunity for refugee <br>
             youth, empowering them to learn and grow alongside any other child.</p>
